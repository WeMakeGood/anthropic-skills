# Creating Organization Dossiers

<purpose>
Claude's default research mode produces surface-level summaries that look comprehensive
but lack verification. Organizational dossiers require verified intelligence, not
plausible-sounding narratives. This skill exists to enforce source attribution for
every factual claim and explicit marking of inferences versus confirmed facts.
</purpose>

Build comprehensive organizational profiles by systematically gathering and synthesizing public information.

## Critical Rules

**SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:** Every factual claim MUST cite its source (website page, 990 filing, user-provided document). Never present inferences as facts.

**EPISTEMIC MARKERS:** Use these consistently throughout the dossier:
- `[Source: website/about]` — information from a specific source
- `[Source: 990 FY2023]` — information from tax filings
- `[Inferred]` — reasonable inference from available data
- `[Unverified]` — claimed by organization, not independently verified
- `[Outdated: YYYY]` — information that may no longer be current

**PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVITY:** Report what you find, including concerns or red flags. If financials show declining revenue, leadership turnover is high, or public information is inconsistent — say so directly. The user needs accurate intelligence, not a favorable summary.

**ANALYTICAL DEPTH:** Don't default to the most obvious framework for analyzing an organization. Consider cross-domain parallels and alternative framings when they produce better insight. Mark novel analogies as such.

**SECOND-ORDER THINKING:** Push past first-order observations. If revenue is growing, ask what that growth depends on and what it constrains. If a leadership change occurred, consider what it enables and what institutional knowledge it may have cost. Name both sides.

**CONTEXTUAL SOURCING:** When applying an analytical framework (competitive analysis, financial benchmarking, sector comparison), note what situation the framework was designed for and whether it fits this organization's context.

**NATURAL PROSE (for Executive Summary and narrative sections):** Write like a research analyst, not an AI assistant. Avoid: pivotal, crucial, vibrant, tapestry, delve, foster, leverage, "not only X but Y," "serves as." Use direct language: "Revenue is $2.4M" not "Revenue stands at $2.4M."

## Before Starting

Gather requirements interactively:

1. **"What organization should I research?"**
   - Organization name (required)
   - Website URL (if known)
   - EIN for nonprofits (if known)

2. **"What's the purpose of this dossier?"**
   - Prospect research / client onboarding
   - Partnership evaluation
   - Grant application research
   - General background

3. **"Do you have any additional materials?"**
   - Existing documents about the organization
   - Previous correspondence
   - Specific areas of interest or concern

4. **Check for context files:**
   - Look for requester context (who is doing the research and why)
   - Look for organizational context about the requester
   - These inform the "alignment analysis" section

Store as:
- `ORG_NAME` - target organization name
- `ORG_URL` - website URL
- `ORG_EIN` - EIN (for nonprofits)
- `PURPOSE` - why this dossier is being created
- `REQUESTER_CONTEXT` - who is requesting and their goals

## Workflow

```
Dossier Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Gather requirements
- [ ] Phase 2: Collect website content
- [ ] Phase 3: Retrieve 990 data (if nonprofit)
- [ ] Phase 4: Process additional materials
- [ ] Phase 5: Synthesize findings
- [ ] Phase 6: Generate dossier
```

<phase_gather>
### Phase 1: Gather Requirements

Use the questions above. If user provides organization name without other details, search for:
- Official website
- Nonprofit status (check if they have 990 filings)
- Basic public information

**GATE (file/artifact):** Before proceeding, write:
- "Organization: [name]"
- "Purpose: [why this dossier is being created]"
- "Data collection plan: [scripts to run, sources to check]"

**GATE (inline):** Verify internally before proceeding. Do not output.
</phase_gather>

<phase_collect>
### Phase 2: Collect Website Content

Choose the collection method based on available tools:

#### Path A: web_search + web_fetch (preferred)

Use this path when web_search and web_fetch tools are available. These produce cleaner, more reliable results than the scraper script.

1. **Fetch the homepage:** `web_fetch` on `ORG_URL`
2. **Identify key pages** from homepage links — look for About, Team/Staff, Board, Programs/Services, Impact, Partners, Contact
3. **Fetch each key page** using `web_fetch` on discovered URLs
4. **Fill gaps with web_search:** Use `site:<domain> about team programs board leadership` to discover pages not linked from the homepage
5. **Fetch any additional pages** found via search

Target pages: Homepage, About, Team/Staff, Board, Programs/Services, Impact, Partners, Contact, Financials/Annual Report.

**Note:** web_fetch does not render JavaScript. If a page returns minimal content, try web_search for cached or indexed versions.

#### Path B: Scraper script (bash environments)

Use this path when bash is available and web_search/web_fetch are not, or if Path A returns insufficient results.

```bash
python3 scripts/scrape_website.py <ORG_URL> --output ./tmp/<org-name>
```

Review output in `./tmp/<org-name>/`:
- `scrape_manifest.json` - what was found
- `homepage.md` - main page content
- `about.md`, `team.md`, etc. - categorized content

If the script fails (no internet, missing packages), switch to Path A immediately. Do not retry or attempt to install packages in sandboxed environments.

#### Supplemental

Regardless of path, if key pages are missing, ask the user for specific URLs.

**GATE (file/artifact):** Before proceeding, write:
- "Collection method: [Path A / Path B]"
- "Pages collected: [list categories found]"
- "Missing categories: [what wasn't found or needs manual lookup]"

**GATE (inline):** Verify internally before proceeding. Do not output.
</phase_collect>

<phase_990>
### Phase 3: Retrieve 990 Data (Nonprofits)

**Skip this phase** for non-U.S. organizations or for-profit companies.

Choose the retrieval method based on available tools:

#### Path A: web_search + web_fetch (preferred)

1. **Search ProPublica:** `web_search` for `"<ORG_NAME>" site:projects.propublica.org` — or use the API directly:
   - By name: `web_fetch` on `https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api/v2/search.json?q=<ORG_NAME>`
   - By EIN (more reliable): `web_fetch` on `https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api/v2/organizations/<EIN>.json`
2. **Parse the JSON response** to extract: revenue, expenses, assets, employee counts, fiscal years covered
3. **For additional detail:** fetch the organization's ProPublica page for filing PDFs and trend data

#### Path B: 990 script (bash environments)

Use when bash is available and web_search/web_fetch are not.

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_990.py "<ORG_NAME>" --output ./tmp/<org-name>
```

Or with known EIN (more reliable):
```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_990.py --ein <EIN> --output ./tmp/<org-name>
```

If the script fails, switch to Path A immediately.

#### Either path

Target data: recent 990 filings (up to 5 years), revenue, expenses, assets, employee/volunteer counts, PDF links to original filings.

**If no results from either path:** Organization may not e-file. Try `web_search` for GuideStar/Candid listings, or ask user for 990 PDFs.

**GATE (file/artifact):** Before proceeding, write:
- "990 retrieval method: [Path A / Path B]"
- "990 data available: [yes/no]"
- "Years covered: [list fiscal years]" or "Skipped: [reason]"

**GATE (inline):** Verify internally before proceeding. Do not output.
</phase_990>

<phase_materials>
### Phase 4: Process Additional Materials

Read any user-provided materials:
- Previous meeting notes
- Correspondence
- Annual reports
- Press coverage
- Strategic plans

Extract relevant information for each dossier section.

**GATE (file/artifact):** Before proceeding, write:
- "Additional materials processed: [list or 'none provided']"
- "Key information extracted: [brief summary]"

**GATE (inline):** Verify internally before proceeding. Do not output.
</phase_materials>

<phase_synthesize>
### Phase 5: Synthesize Findings

**GATE (file/artifact):** Before writing the dossier, list your sources:
- "Mission statement source: [page/document]"
- "Financial data source: [990 year or document]"
- "Leadership info source: [page/document]"
- "Program details source: [page/document]"

**GATE (inline):** Verify sources internally before proceeding. Do not output.

If any section lacks a source, note it here and address in Information Gaps.

**Organizational Understanding:**
- Core mission and theory of change — cite specific source
- Key programs and how they work — cite specific source
- Leadership structure and key decision-makers — cite specific source
- Financial health and sustainability — cite 990 data with fiscal year
- Strategic direction — cite source or mark as "[Inferred from available data]"

**If requester context exists, analyze:**
- Mission alignment
- Potential collaboration areas
- Shared values or approach
- Service/partnership fit

**CRITICAL — Identify and report:**
- **Gaps:** What information is missing? What needs verification?
- **Concerns:** Any red flags, inconsistencies, or issues found
- **Limitations:** Where is data outdated, self-reported, or unverifiable?

Do not omit concerns to make the dossier more favorable. The user needs accurate intelligence.
</phase_synthesize>

<phase_generate>
### Phase 6: Generate and Deliver Dossier

Use the template in [references/DOSSIER-TEMPLATE.md](references/DOSSIER-TEMPLATE.md).

Key sections:
1. Executive Summary
2. Organizational Overview (mission, vision, values)
3. Leadership & Governance
4. Programs & Services
5. Financial Profile
6. Partnerships & Collaborations
7. Digital Presence
8. Strategic Analysis (if requester context provided)
9. Information Gaps & Next Steps

Deliver per the Output Rules above. If writing to file, use `<org-name>-dossier.md`.
</phase_generate>

## Output Rules

The user controls how the dossier is delivered by including a keyword in their request:

- **"as a file"** → Write to `<org-name>-dossier.md`. After saving, confirm with a brief summary of key findings.
- **"as an artifact"** → Create an artifact containing the complete dossier.
- **No keyword (default)** → Return the complete dossier inline in your response.

When delivering inline (the default), execute all workflow phases internally — do not output progress checklists, gate statements, or intermediate extraction notes. Return only the final dossier.

When delivering as a file or artifact, show the progress checklist and write gate statements visibly before proceeding through each phase.

## Key Principles

**Thorough and honest:**
- Cite sources for every factual claim
- Distinguish organization's own claims from third-party verification
- Flag discrepancies between sources — do not resolve them silently
- Mark inferences explicitly with "[Inferred]"

**Objective, not favorable:**
- Report concerns and red flags directly
- If financial trends are negative, say so
- If leadership appears unstable, note it
- If public information is sparse or inconsistent, flag this as a limitation
- The user's decision quality depends on accurate information, not positive framing

**Respect the purpose:**
- Tailor depth to the stated purpose
- Prospect research needs different emphasis than general background
- Include alignment analysis only when requester context exists

**Note limitations:**
- 990 data lags 1-2 years behind current — always note fiscal year
- Website content may be outdated — note if "last updated" dates are visible
- Self-reported information is not independently verified unless stated
- Always recommend verification for key decisions

## Example

**Input:**
```
Create a dossier on Community Bridges Foundation.
Website: https://communitybridges.org
Purpose: Evaluating as potential grantee
```

**Process:**
1. Scrape website content
2. Fetch 990 data
3. Synthesize findings
4. Generate dossier

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown
# Community Bridges Foundation - Organizational Dossier

## What DOESN'T Work

- **Writing before collecting data:** Always complete Phase 2 and Phase 3 data collection before writing any dossier content.
- **Retrying scripts in sandboxed containers:** If scrape_website.py or fetch_990.py fails due to no internet or missing packages, switch to web_search/web_fetch immediately. Do not retry, attempt to install packages, or debug the script environment.
- **Synthesizing without source verification:** Before writing any section, identify the exact source for each claim. "I'll verify later" means never.
- **Presenting inferences as facts:** If you deduce something from context (e.g., "likely a small team based on website"), mark it [Inferred]. Readers need to know what's verified vs reasoned.
- **Favorable framing of concerns:** If financials show declining revenue, say "Revenue declined 15% from $X to $Y." Don't soften it to "Revenue faced some headwinds."
- **Skipping the gaps section:** Every dossier has information gaps. Identifying what you DON'T know is as valuable as what you do know.
