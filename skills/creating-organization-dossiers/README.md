# Creating Organization Dossiers

A skill for Claude that creates comprehensive organizational profiles through systematic research.

## What It Does

This skill guides Claude through a 6-phase workflow to research an organization and produce a structured dossier covering:

- Executive Summary
- Organizational Overview (mission, vision, values, history)
- Programs & Services
- Leadership & Governance
- Financial Profile (from IRS 990 data for nonprofits)
- Partnerships & Collaborations
- Digital Presence
- Strategic Analysis (when requester context is available)
- Information Gaps & Next Steps

## When to Use It

**Trigger phrases that work well:**

- "Create a dossier on [Organization Name]"
- "I need prospect research on [Organization]"
- "Run a due diligence report on [Organization]"
- "Generate an organization report on [Organization]"
- "Build an org profile for [Organization]"

**Use cases:**

- Prospect research before client outreach
- Due diligence for partnerships or grants
- Client onboarding background research
- Preparing for meetings with new organizations
- Evaluating potential grantees or partners

## How It Works

### In Claude Code (CLI)

The skill includes Python scripts that automate data collection:

1. **Website Scraper** (`scripts/scrape_website.py`)
   - Discovers pages via sitemap.xml or navigation crawling
   - Extracts content from About, Team, Board, Programs, Impact pages
   - Outputs markdown files for each category

2. **990 Fetcher** (`scripts/fetch_990.py`)
   - Searches ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer API
   - Retrieves 5 years of financial data
   - Outputs formatted markdown with revenue, expenses, assets

### In Claude AI (Web)

When scripts aren't available, Claude uses web search and web fetch to gather equivalent information manually.

## Outputs

By default, the skill returns the dossier inline in the conversation. You can change this with a keyword in your request:

| Request | Output |
|---------|--------|
| "Create a dossier on Acme Corp" | Returns dossier inline |
| "Create a dossier on Acme Corp **as a file**" | Writes `acme-corp-dossier.md` to disk |
| "Create a dossier on Acme Corp **as an artifact**" | Creates a Claude artifact |

When outputting as a file or artifact, the skill shows progress checkpoints as it works. When outputting inline, it runs silently and returns only the final dossier.

- **Source files:** `tmp/[org-name]/` - raw scraped content and 990 data (in Claude Code)

## Script Dependencies

If using Claude Code, install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 html2text lxml
```

## Example

**Input:**
```
Create a dossier on Community Foundation of Greater Memphis
Website: https://cfgm.org
Purpose: Evaluating as potential funder
```

**Output:** A 200-400 line markdown dossier with:
- Financial trends from 990 filings
- Board composition and leadership bios
- Program areas and grantmaking focus
- Strategic fit analysis based on your stated purpose

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide the website URL** - helps the scraper find the right pages
2. **State your purpose** - enables relevant strategic analysis
3. **Mention if it's a nonprofit** - triggers 990 data lookup
4. **Provide EIN if known** - more reliable 990 retrieval

## Limitations

- 990 data lags 1-2 years behind current (IRS filing delays)
- Website scraping depends on site structure and accessibility
- Private companies have limited public financial data
- Some organizations don't e-file 990s (paper filers not in ProPublica)
