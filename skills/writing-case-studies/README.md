# Writing Case Studies - User Guide

This skill creates case studies as **teaching documents** - not project reports.

## The Core Idea

Case studies teach readers how to solve problems, using your project as a running illustration.

**Wrong:** "Here's what happened in our project."
**Right:** "Here's how to solve this problem - and here's proof it works."

The subject is illustration, not protagonist.

## What You'll Get

- Case study that teaches specific techniques
- Platform versions (blog, LinkedIn, email)
- Social media posts
- Metadata for publishing

## What to Prepare

1. **Source content** - Transcript, notes, or outline
2. **Context** - Who are the readers? What problems do they face? What techniques would help them?
3. **Background files** - Anything that helps understand the subject

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Reader Questions
The skill identifies 3-5 questions your target readers have. You confirm these are the right questions.

### Phase 2: Extract Techniques
Source content is analyzed to find **techniques you can teach** that answer reader questions - not just what happened.

### Phase 3: Plan Structure
Case study is organized around techniques to teach, with a through-line (reader transformation from overwhelmed to equipped).

### Phase 4: Draft
Each section teaches a technique. The subject appears as illustration, not protagonist. "Get Started" section provides specific, actionable next steps.

### Phase 5: Review
You approve the draft before asset generation.

### Phase 6: Assets
Platform versions, social posts, metadata.

## Key Principles

### Teach, Don't Report
Every section must teach something the reader can implement. If you're just describing what happened, it's not a case study - it's a report.

### Protect the Subject
Default to anonymization. Don't expose financial difficulties, org dysfunction, or embarrassing metrics. Use percentages instead of dollar amounts unless approved.

### Specific Next Steps
The "Get Started" section must give readers something new and actionable - specific tools, resources, techniques by name. No platitudes like "start by defining your goals."

### Cut Ruthlessly
If it doesn't teach a technique the reader can use, cut it. Internal details, operational metrics, platform migrations - readers don't need them.

## Output Location

Files go to the directory you confirm at the start (default: `./tmp/`).
