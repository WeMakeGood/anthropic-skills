# Writing Case Studies - User Guide

This skill creates case studies that answer reader questions, using your project as proof.

## The Core Idea

Case studies aren't about telling your story. They're about answering questions your readers already have—and using your project as evidence that the answers work.

**The subject is proof, not the protagonist.**

## What You'll Get

- Case study draft structured around reader questions
- Platform versions (blog, LinkedIn, email)
- Social media posts
- Metadata for publishing

## What to Prepare

1. **Source content** - Transcript, notes, or outline
2. **Context** - Who are the readers? What problems do they face?
3. **Background files** - Anything that helps understand the subject

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Reader Questions
The skill identifies 3-5 questions your target readers have. You confirm these are the right questions.

### Phase 2: Extract Answers
Source content is analyzed to find answers, proof, and quotes for each question.

### Phase 3: Plan Structure
Case study is organized around reader questions—not chronology, not "our process."

### Phase 4: Draft
Each paragraph must answer a reader question. If it doesn't, it gets cut.

### Phase 5: Review
You approve the draft before asset generation.

### Phase 6: Assets
Platform versions, social posts, metadata.

## Key Principles

### Readers First
Start with what readers need to know, not what you want to tell them.

### Protect the Subject
Default to anonymization. Don't expose financial difficulties, org dysfunction, or embarrassing metrics. The subject trusted you with their story.

### Honesty Builds Trust
Include a "What We'd Do Differently" section. Specific lessons, not vague platitudes.

### Cut Ruthlessly
If it doesn't answer a reader question, cut it. Internal details, operational metrics, platform migrations—readers don't need them.

## Output Location

Files go to the directory you confirm at the start (default: `./tmp/`).
