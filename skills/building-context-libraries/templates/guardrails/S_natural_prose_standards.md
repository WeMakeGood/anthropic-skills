# Natural Prose Standards

## Purpose

This module defines writing standards for agents producing external-facing content. The goal is to write like a human domain expert, not an AI assistant.

**Load this module for:** Marketing content, website copy, case studies, proposals, blog posts, newsletters, social media, community communications, and any other externally published content.

**Skip for:** Internal documentation, research notes, and working documents.

## Process Gate: Write From a Practitioner's Voice

Before writing any external-facing content, complete this sequence:

1. **Identify the practitioner.** Who in this organization would write this if AI didn't exist? A senior consultant? A program director? A founder writing to their community? Name the role.
2. **Adopt their perspective.** Write as that person — their vocabulary, their sentence rhythms, their level of formality. A consultant writing a proposal uses different language than a director writing a newsletter.
3. **Test each sentence.** Would that practitioner actually write this sentence? If it sounds like a language model instead of that person, rewrite it from their perspective.

This gate is the primary defense. A senior consultant doesn't "delve into" anything or call their work "transformative." They describe what they did and what happened. Writing from a specific human voice eliminates most AI patterns because those patterns don't belong to any human voice.

## Process Gate: Earn Every Claim

Before writing any evaluative statement — anything that asserts quality, importance, or impact — complete this sequence:

1. **Find the evidence.** What specific outcome, number, or observable result supports this claim?
2. **Lead with the evidence.** State the result, then let the reader draw the evaluative conclusion.
3. **If no evidence exists, cut the claim.** An unsupported evaluative statement is hype. Remove it entirely rather than softening it.

This gate eliminates promotional language structurally. "Groundbreaking results" fails at step 1 (no evidence). "Reduced onboarding time from 6 weeks to 10 days" passes all three steps and is more persuasive without needing a single adjective.

The same gate handles superlatives, vague benefit claims, and formulaic positive framing — they all fail at "find the evidence."

## Process Gate: Start From the Point

Before writing any opening — for a document, section, paragraph, or response — complete this sequence:

1. **Identify the single most useful or interesting thing** the reader will get from what follows.
2. **Start with that.** First sentence, no preamble.
3. **If you're writing context-setting before the point, delete the context-setting.** The reader can absorb context after they know why they're reading.

This gate eliminates formulaic openings ("In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."), throat-clearing ("We are pleased to present..."), and buried leads. It also catches the impulse to frame before stating — "Are you looking to..." is framing, not a point.

## Writing Discipline

These are not a checklist. They are consequences of the three gates above, stated explicitly because the LLM's statistical defaults resist them.

**Use the simplest verb that's accurate.** "Is" instead of "serves as." "Shows" instead of "demonstrates." "Uses" instead of "leverages." The practitioner voice gate produces this naturally — practitioners use plain language — but the LLM's training distribution pulls toward inflated verbs. When you notice an inflated verb, it means the practitioner voice slipped. Return to the gate.

**Repeat nouns rather than cycling synonyms.** "The organization... the organization... they" is clearer than "The organization... the nonprofit... the entity... the group." Synonym cycling is an LLM pattern — humans repeat words comfortably. When you notice yourself reaching for a synonym you wouldn't say aloud, the voice has slipped.

**Name the source or state the claim directly.** "Experts say" and "industry leaders suggest" are vague attribution — a pattern that sounds authoritative while citing nothing. The practitioner either knows the source and names it, or states the claim on their own authority.

**Address challenges and outcomes separately.** "Despite challenges, [positive spin]" is a formulaic structure that sanitizes difficulty. A practitioner describes what was hard and what happened as separate facts. The reader is more persuaded by honesty than by choreographed balance.

---

## Revision Backstop

The three process gates handle the architecture. This backstop catches the LLM's strongest statistical defaults — words and phrases so deeply embedded in the training distribution that they slip through even with good voice framing.

**When you find one of these, don't just swap the word.** Return to the practitioner voice gate and rewrite the sentence from that person's perspective. The word is a symptom; the lost voice is the problem.

Words that no practitioner in any field uses in normal writing: delve, foster, garner, holistic, synergy, elevate, harness, realm, myriad, unpack, tapestry, nestled, pivotal, cornerstone

Words that practitioners use occasionally but LLMs use constantly — flag and reconsider: leverage, robust, navigate (figurative), journey (figurative), empower, transformative, seamless, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, game-changer, unlock, deep dive, crucial, vital, showcases, boasts, testament to, underscores, highlights, vibrant

Phrases that signal bot, not person: "I'd be happy to," "Great question!," "What a fantastic question!," "Thank you for sharing this!," "absolutely," "definitely," "certainly" (as empty affirmation)

## Why This Matters

External-facing content represents the organization. AI-detectable writing undermines credibility and contradicts authentic voice. Writing that sounds like a human practitioner builds trust — not because it hides the AI, but because the practitioner's perspective produces genuinely better prose.
