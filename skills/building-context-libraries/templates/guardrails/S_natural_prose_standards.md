# Natural Prose Standards

## Purpose

This module defines writing standards for agents producing external-facing content. The goal is to write like a human domain expert, not an AI assistant. LLMs have distinctive verbal tics that trained readers recognize instantly — these standards eliminate them.

**Load this module for:** Marketing content, website copy, case studies, proposals, blog posts, newsletters, social media, community communications, and any other externally published content.

**Skip for:** Internal documentation, research notes, and working documents.

## Core Principle

**Write like a domain expert in your field, not an AI assistant.**

The test: Would a human professional in this role write this way? If the answer is "no, this sounds like ChatGPT," revise.

## Banned Structures

### Parallelisms That Oversell
**Don't:** "Not only X, but Y"
**Do:** State both facts directly

### Copula Avoidance
**Don't:** "serves as" / "stands as"
**Do:** Use "is"

Example:
- Wrong: "This document serves as a guide..."
- Right: "This document is a guide..."

### Empty -ing Analysis
**Don't:** "highlighting the importance of..." / "showcasing their commitment to..." / "exploring the significance of..."
**Do:** State what's important directly

### Vague Attribution
**Don't:** "experts say" / "industry leaders suggest"
**Do:** Name the source or state directly

### Formulaic Balance
**Don't:** "Despite challenges, [positive spin]"
**Do:** Address challenges and outcomes separately and honestly

### Formulaic Openings
**Don't:**
- "In today's [adjective] world/landscape..."
- "Are you looking to..."
- "Do you want to..."
- "In this episode, we discuss..."
- "We are pleased to present..."

**Do:** Lead with the most interesting or relevant point

---

## Required Behaviors

### Use Simple Verbs
- "is" not "serves as"
- "shows" not "demonstrates"
- "helps" not "empowers"
- "uses" not "leverages"

### Repeat Nouns
Don't cycle through synonyms to avoid repetition. Repeating the same noun is clearer than forcing variety.

Example:
- Wrong: "The organization... the nonprofit... the entity... the group..."
- Right: "The organization... the organization... they..."

### Be Specific
- Use numbers when you have them
- Name names (when appropriate)
- Give concrete examples instead of abstract claims
- Avoid vague benefit statements without supporting details

### Match Domain Voice
Write how actual practitioners in the field write. Consult organization-specific voice modules for guidance.

### Lead with Value
- Start with the most interesting or useful point
- Don't bury the lead under context-setting
- Get to the answer quickly

### Avoid Overselling
- Let the content speak for itself
- Don't use superlatives without evidence
- Understatement is often more credible than hype

---

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Proposals and Client Communications
- Show understanding of their specific situation
- Be specific about what will be delivered
- Avoid vague benefit claims
- Match consultative, not sales-y tone

### Case Studies
- Lead with specific details, not generalizations
- Be specific with numbers and names (where not anonymized)
- Balance narrative with practical application
- Be honest about what worked AND what didn't

### Blog Posts and Articles
- Start with concrete examples, not abstract claims
- Avoid superlatives without evidence
- Name sources rather than vague attribution

### Community Responses
- Get to the answer quickly
- Be direct and helpful
- Sound like a real person, not a bot
- Avoid overly enthusiastic openings

### Marketing Copy
- Lead with value, not hype
- Be specific — avoid vague benefit claims
- No formulaic openings ("Are you looking to...")
- Professional but accessible tone

## The Revision Test

Before finalizing external-facing content, ask:

1. **AI Detection:** Would this trigger an AI content detector? If yes, revise.
2. **Domain Expert:** Would a human expert in this role write this way? If no, revise.
3. **Banned Words:** Scan for banned vocabulary. Remove any found.
4. **Banned Structures:** Check for banned patterns. Restructure as needed.
5. **Specificity:** Are claims specific or vague? Add details or remove claims.
6. **Credibility:** Does this oversell? Tone down hype.

---

## Why This Matters

External-facing content represents the organization. AI-detectable writing:
- Undermines credibility
- Signals lack of care
- Triggers skepticism in readers
- Contradicts authentic voice

Writing that sounds human and expert:
- Builds trust
- Demonstrates expertise
- Respects the audience
- Aligns with organizational values
