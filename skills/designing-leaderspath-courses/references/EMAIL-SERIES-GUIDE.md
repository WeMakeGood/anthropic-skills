# Course Email Series Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for Phase 7 of the designing-leaderspath-courses workflow. Phase 7 runs AFTER the meta-analysis (Phase 6) is complete.

## Purpose

The course email series threads standalone lessons into a single learning arc. These emails frame, connect, and extend the course experience beyond individual sessions.

## Dependency

**Phase 7 cannot run without Phase 6.** The meta-analysis produces:
- Curated article lists organized by theme
- Curated video lists organized by lesson
- Between-session activity recommendations
- Gap analysis identifying what needs reinforcement

These feed directly into the post-session emails.

## Email Types

The series includes four email types:

| Type | Timing | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Welcome | 1 week before Session 1 | Set expectations, pre-reading, frame the journey |
| Post-session | Within 24 hours of each session | Anchor, bridge, prepare |
| Final session | Within 24 hours of last session | Close the arc, provide resource library |
| One-month check-in | 30 days after last session | Gather feedback, share developments |

## Tone Guidance

**CRITICAL:** These emails must be direct, warm, and substantive. Not marketing copy.

**Do:**
- Write like people who care about the work, to people doing the work
- Be specific and concrete
- Give readers something to think about, not just a summary
- Use active voice

**Do not:**
- Use "we hope you enjoyed" filler
- Use exclamation points
- Write promotional or marketing copy
- Pad with unnecessary pleasantries

**Example tone:**

```
# Bad (promotional)
We're so excited to welcome you to this amazing learning journey!
We hope you're as thrilled as we are about the incredible opportunities ahead!

# Good (substantive)
Welcome to the Ethical AI for Nonprofit Leaders course.

Over the next six weeks, you'll work through a progression designed to
change how you think about AI — not just how you use it.
```

## Email 1: Welcome Email

**Send:** 1 week before Session 1

### Structure

```markdown
**Subject:** Your course starts [date] — one thing to read before we meet

---

[Opening: What to expect from the course — 2-3 paragraphs]

**A few things to know going in:**

[3-4 bullet points about format, tools, approach]

**One thing to read before we meet:**

[1 article tied to the course's central theme — include title, author if notable, and 1-2 sentence framing]

[Closing: Brief, no homework pressure]

— The [Team Name] Team

**Optional pre-viewing:**

[2-3 short videos that provide helpful context — include titles, lengths, and brief descriptions]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Pre-reading selection:**
- One article that introduces the course's thematic spine
- Should be thought-provoking, not instructional
- From a credible source

**Optional pre-viewing:**
- 2-3 videos under 10 minutes each
- From the meta-analysis's curated video list
- Provide context for Session 1 themes

---

## Emails 2-N: Post-Session Emails

**Send:** Within 24 hours of each session

### The Three Jobs

Every post-session email has exactly three jobs:

1. **Anchor** — One paragraph on the key takeaway from this session (not a recap of everything)
2. **Bridge** — A between-session activity that connects this session's learning to the next
3. **Prepare** — 1-2 curated resources that prime learners for NEXT session's themes

### Structure

```markdown
**Subject:** [Key concept from session] — and what's coming next

---

[Opening: Thank you, brief acknowledgment]

[2-4 key takeaways as bold headers with 1-2 sentence explanations each]

### Before next session

**One thing to try this week:**

[Lightweight, specific activity — 2-3 sentences max]

**Reading for next week (pick one):**

- "[Article Title]" ([Source]) — [1 sentence description]
- "[Article Title]" ([Source]) — [1 sentence description]

**Watch ([X] min):**

- "[Video Title]" ([length]) — [1 sentence description]

[Brief closing referencing next session]
```

### Content Guidelines

**Anchor (key takeaways):**
- Select 3-5 ideas worth holding onto
- Use bold headers for each
- Keep explanations to 1-2 sentences
- Don't recap everything — focus on what matters most

**Bridge (between-session activity):**
- Must be lightweight and specific
- Doable in 5-10 minutes
- Connects this session's learning to next session's themes
- Should produce something learners can bring back

**Good activities:**
- "Notice one moment where you experience [concept] in your work. Write 2-3 sentences."
- "Find one example of [concept] in your daily life. What gave it away?"
- "List five [items related to next session's theme]."
- "Try one [specific action]. Bring one observation."

**Bad activities:**
- "Write a comprehensive plan for..." (too heavy)
- "Reflect on your learnings" (too vague)
- "Read the entire documentation for..." (too time-consuming)

**Prepare (resources for next session):**
- Resources should be relevant to NEXT session's themes, not the current session
- Learners just experienced the current session — they need preparation, not reinforcement
- Select from the meta-analysis's curated lists
- Maximum 2 articles + 1 video per email
- All resources under 15 minutes to consume

---

## Email N+1: Final Session Email

**Send:** Within 24 hours of last session

### Structure

```markdown
**Subject:** [Reference to framework/deliverable] — and that's the point

---

[Opening: Acknowledge what learners accomplished in the final session]

**What to hold onto from this entire course:**

[3-4 key themes that run through the whole course, with 1-2 sentence explanations]

### Your [deliverable name]

[1-2 paragraphs about the deliverable they created and how to use it going forward]

### Resources to keep

[Curated resource library organized by category — bookmarks from across the course]

[Closing: Thank you, brief and sincere]

— The [Team Name] Team
```

### Content Guidelines

**Closing the arc:**
- Reference the thematic spine introduced in the welcome email
- Bring ideas full circle
- Focus on the course-level learning, not just the last session

**Resource library:**
- Organize by category (e.g., "For your team:", "For ongoing reference:")
- Include the most valuable resources from across all sessions
- This is a reference section, not homework

---

## Email N+2: One-Month Check-In

**Send:** 30 days after last session

### Structure

```markdown
**Subject:** One month later — how's your [deliverable] holding up?

---

[Opening: Acknowledge the time that's passed]

**[N] questions we're genuinely curious about:**

1. [Specific question about deliverable use]
2. [Specific question about behavior/thinking change]
3. [Specific question about what stuck]

[Request for reply with answers]

**A few things that have happened since we met:**

[2-3 recent, relevant developments — this section requires manual update at send time]

**Staying connected:**

[Invitation to continue engagement, contact information]

[Brief closing about practice continuing]

— The [Team Name] Team
```

### Content Guidelines

**Feedback questions:**
- Must be specific, not generic satisfaction questions
- Focus on: framework/deliverable use, behavior changes, what stuck
- 2-3 questions maximum

**Good questions:**
- "Have you used your AI ethics framework? Did it hold up against your real work?"
- "What changed? Not 'are you using AI more' — are you thinking about it differently?"
- "Of everything we covered, what has actually made a difference in your day-to-day?"

**Bad questions:**
- "Did you enjoy the course?"
- "Would you recommend us to a colleague?"
- "Rate your experience 1-10"

**Recent developments section:**
- This section CANNOT be pre-written
- Mark it as requiring manual update at send time
- Include placeholder guidance for what to include:
  - Recent research or product updates relevant to course themes
  - Policy developments affecting the target audience
  - New resources or tools that connect to what was covered

---

## Threading the Thematic Spine

**CRITICAL:** Identify 1-2 ideas that run through the entire course. Reference them in every email.

### How to identify the spine

Look for concepts that:
- Appear in the source materials repeatedly
- Inform multiple lessons
- Represent the course's core insight or reframe

### How to thread it

| Email | How to Reference |
|-------|------------------|
| Welcome | Introduce the frame explicitly |
| Post-session 1-N | Touch it — connect session content back to the frame |
| Final session | Bring it home — show how the course delivered on the frame |
| One-month | Reference it in feedback questions |

### Example

For an "Ethical AI" course, the thematic spine might be:
- "Productive friction" — what we lose when AI removes struggle
- "Ethical AI as user practice" — ethics come from you, not the AI

The welcome email introduces these frames. Every post-session email connects the session's content back to these ideas. The final email synthesizes how the course addressed them.

---

## Resource Curation Criteria

For all curated resources in post-session emails:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Timing | Relevant to NEXT session's themes (not current) |
| Accessibility | Accessible to non-technical leaders |
| Length | Under 15 minutes to consume |
| Source | Credible (Anthropic, HBR, Stanford, Pew, Brookings, SSIR) |
| Angle | Adds new perspective (not repeat of lesson content) |

**Why resources point forward, not back:**
- Learners just experienced the current session — they don't need reinforcement
- Forward-pointing resources prime learners for upcoming themes
- This creates anticipation and continuity across the course
